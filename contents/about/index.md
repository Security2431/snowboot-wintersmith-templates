### AH. Andreas Hulstkamp

Does the world need another blog? No.  
Should my brain use an external memory? Yes. For experimentation, for reference, for getting things nailed.

I’m currently living in Switzerland. I hold a master of science from the University of Bern, where I majored in cognitive psychology in the field of Human Computer Interaction and minored in computer science. I’m especially interested in all things interactive, be it on the web, on mobile or interactive works in an art gallery. Apart from my job as a Frontend- (JS/HTML*/CSS*, Flex, Flash) and Backend-Engineer (JEE, Spring, GO), Analyst and PM I love to experiment with upcoming stuff. Some of it you'll find on this blog.

Besides bits and bytes I have a love for European Football, literature, movies from the 70ies and music (8-bit to distorted analogue).

Some other projects I made or I’m involved are [cityclash.org](http://www.cityclash.org) (beta), [cocomoshi.ch](http://www.cocomoshi.ch) or [onmodular.com](http://www.onmodular.com) (archived – 2002).

Thanks for passing by!

Andreas Hulstkamp
